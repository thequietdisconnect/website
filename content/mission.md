Through living simply, supporting one another, and choosing our own path, we can build something better together.

The Quiet Disconnect’s mission is to empower people to opt out of harmful systems and reconnect with themselves and their communities. We exist to help people learn how to withdraw their consent from systems that tend to exploit, distract, and divide.

By taking back our time, attention, and money, we weaken the hold of unfair systems and strengthen our communities’ ability to make their own choices, care about others, and work together.
## Reasonable Goals

We're not here to burn it down. We're here to stop feeding it. This is how we'll know it's working.

We are power. We are the energy that runs through all things. The system is only as strong as our willingness to feed it.
