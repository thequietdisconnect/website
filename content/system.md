The system isn't just one thing. It's a web of rules, habits, and technologies that keep us dependent, distracted, and divided.
{{< /lead >}}
Most people think of "the system" as government or big business. But it's much bigger and sneakier than that. It's the way debt keeps us working jobs we hate. It's the endless scroll of social media that steals our time and attention. It's surveillance tech that tracks what we do and say. It's consumer culture that tells us to buy more, want more, and to measure our worth in *stuff*.

The system isn't a single conspiracy.
{{< /lead >}}
It's a culture of dependency built into our economy, technology, and daily routines. If you've ever felt exhausted, anxious, or powerless without knowing why, you've already felt the system working.

We don't have to accept these systems as normal. Every [small act of resistance](/action/) matters. Every time we choose privacy, community, or simplicity is a step toward [freedom](/hope/).

They must find it difficult, those who have taken authority as truth, rather than truth as authority.
