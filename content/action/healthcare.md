## What You Can Do
{{< gridlist >}}
### Choose privacy-respecting providers
Ask healthcare providers how they handle your medical data. Use clinics or apps that comply with HIPAA and support apps like CommonHealth that give patients more control.
<--->
### Protect your health data
Avoid “free” health apps that sell data. Use privacy-first options like Bearable (symptom tracking) or Apple Health with data stored locally.
<--->
### Support mental health without exploitation
Back community-based programs, crisis lines like 988 (U.S.), or nonprofits like NAMI instead of for-profit apps that monetize sensitive data.
<--->
### Advocate for universal healthcare
Join campaigns like Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) or Healthcare-NOW! pushing for Medicare for All and accessible care.
<--->
### Push for transparency in pricing
Use resources like Healthcare Bluebook or Fair Health Consumer to compare procedure costs and advocate for clear pricing.
<--->
### Prioritize preventative and holistic care
Support community clinics, fitness programs, and food-as-medicine initiatives that focus on long-term well-being.
<--->
### Educate on root causes
Learn about social determinants of health (housing, food access, and environment) through groups like the World Health Organization (WHO) or Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
<--->
### Support health justice movements
Back organizations like Health Justice Commons, Partners In Health, or The People’s Health Movement working for equity worldwide.
