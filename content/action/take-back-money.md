## What You Can Do
{{< gridlist >}}
### Support local businesses directly
Shop at farmers' markets, independent bookstores, or use tools like Buy Local First directories to keep wealth in your community.
<--->
### Use community-based banks and credit unions
Move your money from "too-big-to-fail" banks into local credit unions or community development financial institutions (CDFIs) that reinvest locally.
<--->
### Track and cancel unused subscriptions
Use services like Trim, Rocket Money, or Bobby to find and cancel subscriptions you don't need.
<--->
### Ditch debt traps
Avoid payday lenders and predatory credit. Try debit-first living or budgeting apps like YNAB (You Need A Budget) or EveryDollar to stay in control.
<--->
### Practice cash-only or debit-only spending
Experiment with a week or month of using only cash or debit to break the debt-as-default cycle.
<--->
### Explore cooperative funding
Join or start a co-op, mutual aid fund, or time bank to share resources and reduce dependence on corporate credit.
<--->
### Invest ethically
If you have savings, consider platforms like Localstake (local investing) or Swell Investing (impact-driven portfolios) to align money with values.
<--->
### Educate yourself on financial literacy
Take free courses like Coursera's Personal & Family Financial Planning or community workshops that teach money skills outside the credit/debt system.
