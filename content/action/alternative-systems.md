Join federated networks like Mastodon (social), Pixelfed (photos), or PeerTube (video) to break away from centralized corporate control.

### Use cooperative platforms
Support platform co-ops such as Resonate (music streaming) or Fairbnb (ethical alternative to Airbnb).
<--->
### Contribute to digital commons
Share knowledge on Wikipedia, support open-access publishing, or upload creative work to Creative Commons licenses.
