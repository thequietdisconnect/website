## What You Can Do
{{< gridlist >}}
### Value your data
Use tools like Terms of Service; Didn't Read to see what platforms really do with your information. Demand transparency by exercising your data rights requests (GDPR/CCPA).
<--->
### Opt out of surveillance-based social media
Delete or minimize use of platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Choose privacy-first alternatives like Mastodon (social), Signal (messaging), or Pixelfed (photos).
<--->
### Audit your devices
Check which of your home gadgets are "listening" (e.g., Alexa, Ring, Google Nest). Replace with non-networked tools or open-source alternatives like Home Assistant.
<--->
### Block hidden trackers
Install privacy browsers like Brave or extensions like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and Decentraleyes to stop data collection in the background.
<--->
### Use encrypted communication
Switch to Signal for messaging, ProtonMail for email, and Mozilla VPN or Mullvad for browsing privately.
<--->
### Resist "smart" convenience traps
Choose wired headphones, analog watches, or stand-alone appliances instead of "smart" versions that track you.
<--->
### Support digital rights organizations
Back groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) or Privacy International fighting surveillance abuse worldwide.
<--->
### Educate and share alternatives
Host workshops, share guides like Surveillance Self-Defense (EFF), and help others break free from surveillance tech.
