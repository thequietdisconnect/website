## What You Can Do
{{< gridlist >}}
### Set digital boundaries
Use Screen Time (iOS), Digital Wellbeing (Android), or apps like Freedom and Cold Turkey to block distracting apps and sites.
<--->
### Create no-phone zones
Designate tech-free spaces (bedroom, dinner table) to separate rest and relationships from screens.
<--->
### Practice presence
Join mindfulness programs like Headspace or Insight Timer, or simply start with daily phone-free walks or meals.
<--->
### Prioritize real connection
Schedule regular in-person time with friends, family, or neighbors. Even small rituals like shared meals can rebuild presence.
<--->
### Build deep focus habits
Use the Pomodoro Technique or Deep Work (Cal Newport) principles to train your attention and limit multitasking.
<--->
### Curate nourishing content
Replace endless scrolling with long-form media: read on Pocket, subscribe to independent newsletters, or listen to podcasts that enrich rather than distract.
<--->
### Unplug intentionally
Try a Digital Sabbath (one screen-free day a week) or join challenges like the National Day of Unplugging.
<--->
### Join the attention resistance
Support movements like the Center for Humane Technology or Time Well Spent, which push back against exploitative design.
